# PosnerCue
Performs a Posner Cueing experiment to investigate human attention.

This program simulates the Posner Cueing method of investigating human attention (1984). The user is asked to fixate their gaze on the center of the window and react to the presence of a red target that appears randomly on-screen. Each grid square may also glow to highlight attention towards that area. If the cue is in the same grid as the target, it is a valid cue. This program carries out a Posner Cueing experiment of 120 trials and investigates the relation between experimental variables and the reaction times of the user.
